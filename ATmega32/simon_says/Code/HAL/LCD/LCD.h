 *
 * @details
 * This driver provides a complete abstraction for interfacing with character
 * LCD modules (16x2 or 16x4) based on the HD44780 controller. It supports both
 * 4-bit and 8-bit communication modes, initialization, and includes cursor tracking,
 * automatic row shifting, and custom character handling.
 *
 * The LCD driver includes the following functionalities:
 * - Initialization of LCD with configurable data/control pin mapping.
 * - Print characters, strings, and numbers.
 * - Cursor positioning and screen clearing.
 * - Custom character creation using CGRAM.
 * - Shift display left/right and get current cursor position.
 *
 * @note
 * - Requires `LCD_config.h` for macro-based configuration.
