 *
 * @details
 * This driver provides functions to interact with the EEPROM of ATmega32 microcontroller.
 * It supports both synchronous and interrupt-driven operations for reading and writing
 * single bytes, arrays, 16-bit and 32-bit integers, and 32-bit floating point values.
 * Additionally, this driver includes interrupt support with a callback mechanism for
 * handling EEPROM operations asynchronously.
 *
 * The EEPROM driver includes the following functionalities:
 * - Write/Read a single byte.
 * - Write/Read an array of bytes.
 * - Write/Read 16-bit and 32-bit integers.
 * - Write/Read 32-bit floating-point values.
 * - EEPROM interrupt enable/disable.
 * - User-defined interrupt callback handler.
